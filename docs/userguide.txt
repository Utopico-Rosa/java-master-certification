1. Introduction/Summary
-----------------------
This user guide enables CSRs of Bodgitt & Scarper to take advantage of a new system for searching client partner companies and booking customers.

-----------------------
2. Application Overview 
-----------------------
This new system enables CSRs to search client partner companies by name and/or location, and for booking customers.

The system is almost entirely graphical based. The only time the CSR may need to use the command line is when starting the system.

Multiple CSRs can access the system at once, and they can run in parallel.

The system has three modes: one to start the remote database server, another to start a local database server and client, and another to start a remote client that connects to the database remote server.

In all this three modes, there´s a setup configuration phase, which can be skipped, after the first run of the system, if on posterior runs, the user wants to use the previous configuration. The system
saves and remembers the user´s previous configuration.

The system is contained in a file with a .jar extension.

---------------------------
3. Application Requirements
---------------------------
Requires (Java Runtime Environment) JRE version 1.6 or greater installed. You can test if if you already have it installed on your computer by typing "java -version" (whithout the quotes) on the command line. If you don´t have it installed you can get it here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html. Should the previous link be broken, you can google it by typing "jre download" (whithout the quotes).

If you´re using the database remote server or the remote client that connects to the database remote server, you need an internet connection.

If you´re running the database remote server on your computer, you must disable your computer´s firewall.

4. How to Run the Application
